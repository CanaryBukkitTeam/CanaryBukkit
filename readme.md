[WIP] CanaryBukkit
=======================

### What is it?
CanaryBukkit allows plugins created for the Bukkit API platform to be used on the CanaryMod server platform.

### License
I have chosen the MIT license for this project.

### Links

### Collaborators
The following teams of LexMinecraft have access to edit this repository: application-dev, mod-team and CanaryBukkit-devteam.

### Things to Note
Despite the fact, I am trying to make sure all plugins are compatible, I cannot assure any plugin you throw at it will work.
